# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction
##### *Quick Note: This previously was a school group project focusing on doing data preparation and visualization. However, I took further step applying machine learning on predicting fraud*
Predicting the repayment ability of the borrowers is important for financial institutions to minimize the risk of loan payment default. However, the fact that many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories makes evaluating ability to repay with the existing evaluation system inappropriate to apply. 
In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, we make use of Kaggle dataset, Home Credit Default Risk, which includes telco and transactional information to predict their clients' repayment abilities. 

## About Home Credit
Home Credit (HC) is an international non-bank financial institution operating in 9 countries and focuses on installment lending primarily to people with little or no credit history.

There are three main product categories:

Revolving Loan (Credit Card): Loan applicant is given a credit limit, he/she can spend/withdraw in a month within that credit limit, and at the end of the month HC will inform him of the minimum payment he needs to make.

Consumer installment loan (Point of sales loan â€“ POS loan): Loan applicant is given a credit limit (not cash) to buy a goods (phone, laptop). Loan applicant will need to repay that credit monthly.

Installment cash loan: Loan applicant is given a lump sum of cash. He/she can spend it for whatever purpose. Loan applicants will need to repay that loan monthly. This type is the same as POS loans, however,  this time customers receive cash instead of credit amount in their banking account. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains 8 csv file. My group already did the EDA for all the files. But I only apply machine learning for the main file: application_train
